Bubbles Fictitious Website

Design Decisions
Designed to represent the golden age of laundrettes with a 50’s style using pink and orange colours and dark purples. I created bubble icons and header to add to the name bubbles and gave them a 3d style and some minor translations/transformations to add animation, to make the bubble appear to be moving. The Main font was used as the ‘B’ also resembled bubbles and was a perfect fit for the design.
I tried to keep this design very simple and I think it would suit a mobile application better than a web page.

Layout
Used Bootstrap for the navbar, layout and also implemented flexbox Bootstrap was used to create modals from the clicked menu items and the floating bubbles in the main section.
Used pseudo elements to add icons/emojis within the modals. 

The Footer contains a bootstrap drop down and some javascript to update the DOM to display the addresses for each location clicked.

Possibly Improvements
I’d consider adding a background image to the main page. I was going to create a faded background image of a row of washing machines.
I would tidy up my footer as it doesn’t look perfect. Id would maybe make the flex items he same size or perhaps removed the borders or change some of the colours used in the footer.
I would consider added a nav brand but it would need a new icon/logo created and I have spent too much time creating graphics
